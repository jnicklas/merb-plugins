MerbJsRoutes
============

MerbJsRoutes makes it possible to use Merb's routing from inside your JavaScript files. First you'll need to add a dependency in init.rb

    dependency "merb_js_routes"
    
end then mount the slice to your root in your router.rb like this:

    r.slice(MerbJsRoutes, :path => "")

Adding all Routes
-----------------

In order to gain access to all routes, simply include the file /javascripts/routes.js in the head of your document, if you are using merb-assets, like this:

    <%= js_include_tag 'routes.js' %>

This is convenient, but might be overkill if you only need a few select routes.

Adding selected routes
----------------------

In the head of your document (or in a dynamically generated JavaScript file, great for caching!) add this:
    
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
  	/* <![CDATA[ */
    	var Url = {};
      <%= js_route(:name_of_route) %>
      <%= js_route(:name_of_another_route) %>
  	/* ]]> */
  	</script>

Using the routes
----------------

You can then use the routes from your JavaScript like this:

    Url.comment({ id: 5 })
    // => /comments/5
    
    Url.project_comment({ id: 5, project_id: 3 })
    // => /projects/3/comments/
    
Oh my!
